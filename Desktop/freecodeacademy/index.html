                <ul>
                    <li>Yar'Adua was born into a titled Fulani family in Katsina on 16 August 1951 </li>
                    <li>His father, Musa Yar'Adua, was a Minister for Lagos in the First Republic and held the chieftaincy title of Matawalle of the Katsina Emirate.</li>
                    <li>He started his education at Rafukka Primary School in 1958, and moved to Dutsinma Boarding Primary School in 1962. </li>
                    <li>He attended the Government College at Keffi from 1965 until 1969. He received a Higher School Certificate from Barewa College. </li>
                    <li> He returned in 1978 to pursue a masters degree in Analytical Chemistry</li>
                    <li>His first employment was at Holy Child College in Lagos (1975–76). He later served as a lecturer at the College of Arts, Science, and Technology in Zaria, Kaduna State between 1976 and 1979. </li>
                    <li>In 1979, he began working as a lecturer at College of Art Science, remaining in this position until 1983, when he began working in the corporate sector.</li>
                    <li>He left Nigeria on 23 November 2009, and was reported to be receiving treatment for pericarditis at a clinic in Saudi Arabia. </li>
                    <li> was not seen in public again, and his absence created a power vacuum which was usurped by a cabal.</li>
                    <li>On 6 March 2007 he was flown to Germany for medical reasons, further fomenting rumors about his health.</li>
                    <li> His spokesperson said this was due to stress and quoted Yar'Adua as saying he was fine and would soon be back to campaigning.</li>

                    <!-- <li>The ruling also stated that the Federal Executive Council should hear testimony of five doctors, one of whom should be Yar'Adua's personal physician.</li> -->

                    <li> Yar'Adua worked at Sambo Farms Ltd in Funtua, Katsina State, as its pioneer General Manager between 1983 and 1989.</li>
                    <li>He served as a Board Member of Katsina State Farmers' Supply Company between 1984 and 1985</li>
                    <li>In 1999, Yar'Adua won the state governorship. He was the first governor to publicly declare his assets.</li>
                    <li>Yar'Adua's administration saw various developments in the state and became the fifth northern Nigerian state to adopt sharia law</li>
                    <li>On 16–17 December 2006, Yar'Adua was chosen as the presidential candidate of the ruling PDP for the April 2007 election, receiving 3,024 votes from party delegates</li>
                    <li> Another report, which was rejected by Yar'Adua's spokesperson, claims that Yar'Adua collapsed after suffering a possible heart attack.</li>
                    <li>On 22 January 2010, the Supreme Court of Nigeria ruled that the Federal Executive Council (FEC) had fourteen days to decide a resolution on whether Yar'Adua was "incapable of discharging the functions of his office".</li>
